  <p> My name is Quentin Napu Ueki Cruz, I also go by Q. I am a Chamorro, Palauan, and Japanese native from the island of Guam who moved to Washington to pursue a degree in Kinesiology which I accomplished in 2019. After completing my degree I moved to seattle where I worked as a personal trainer as well as an exercise specialist at a physical therapy clinic. However, due to recent circumstances I have decided to do a complete career change. My interest in coding/software development started with the help of one my roommates and it was then solidified after I took the 101 course designed by Code Fellows. It is now my dream to become a full stack developer to assist in the healthcare and fitness industry. </p>
